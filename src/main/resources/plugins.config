# A single .jar file can contain multiple plugins, specified in separate lines.
#
# The format is: <menu>, "<menu label>", <class name>
#
# If something like ("<arg>") is appended to the class name, the setup() method
# will get that as arg parameter; otherwise arg is simply the empty string.

# We don't need an explicit plugin menu for reading, since modified
# HandleExtraFileTypes class allows File->Open... and Drag-n-Drop
